Some files for my remarkable.

For settings things up after an update, see [updating](updating.md).

## Wishlist

* some better file manager and offline backup.
  should just work with a normal file manager, or be even easier.
  * should be able to back up notebooks and pdf annotations, possibly in
    version control?
  * there was a custom cloud backup app somewhere.
* should be able to render them in SVG and HTML for loading online.
